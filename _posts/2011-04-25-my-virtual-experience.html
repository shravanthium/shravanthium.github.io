<p style="text-align:justify;">Alight! All of us have used different OS on our local machine(it may be win7 along with xp or fedora).Every time when we wan to run any application on the other OS we have to reboot the system then keep pressing down arrow ,select the required OS so that it can be booted.Tedious isn't it...??!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lets make it simpler by making use of <a title="virtualization" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization" rel="nofollow">virtualization</a>.Virtualization lets you run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine, with each virtual machine sharing the resources of that one physical computer across multiple environments. Different virtual machines can run different operating systems and multiple applications on the same physical computer.Start by eliminating the old “one server, one application” model and run multiple virtual machines on each physical machine.Today let's see how we can use VMWare Player to experience the power of virtualization in our local machine.You can download it <a title="here" href="http://downloads.vmware.com/d/info/desktop_downloads/vmware_player/3_0" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://shravanthimohan.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/untitled.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-35" title="vmplayer" src="assets/untitled.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="229" /></a></p>
<p>Once you complete the installation it would ask you to reboot.After rebooting run VMware player  the following window will be displayed...</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://shravanthimohan.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/vm2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-38" title="vm2" src="assets/vm2.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="256" /> </a>Here in select "create new Virtual Machine" when it asks for the source from where to install select <em>"i will install OS later"</em> and hit next. Select Linux as <em>"guest OS "</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<div><a href="http://shravanthimohan.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/vm23.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-35" title="vm23" src="assets/vm23.png?w=150" alt="" width="348" height="257" /></a></div>
<div>and go next now give <em>name of the virtual machine</em> you want to create browse the location where it is located and hit next.</div>
<div><a href="http://shravanthimohan.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/vm3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-35" title="vm3" src="assets/vm3.png?w=150" alt="" width="339" height="282" /></a></div>
<div>Here also no problem just hit next again, now you have to<em> "customize your hardware "</em>  it has many option just remove whichever you don't need and adjust the RAM based on your machine RAM  capacity and hit next at this point of installation it may take few minutes please be patient. This completes the creation of your virtual machine. <a href="http://shravanthimohan.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/vm4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-35" title="vm4" src="assets/vm4.png?w=150" alt="" width="333" height="278" /></a></div>
<div>Now onwards every time you don't have to reboot your machine to run a Linux based app or some other, just start you machine by clicking on VMware player and selecting your virtual machine.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>some of the major benefits of Virtualization</strong></em>:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Compatibility</strong><br />
Just like a physical computer, a virtual machine hosts its own guest operating system and applications, and has all the components found in a physical computer (motherboard, VGA card, network card controller, etc). As a result, virtual machines are completely compatible with all standard x86 operating systems, applications and device drivers, so you can use a virtual machine to run all the same software that you would run on a physical x86 computer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Isolation</strong><br />
While virtual machines can share the physical resources of a single computer, they remain completely isolated from each other as if they were separate physical machines. Isolation is an important reason why the availability and security of applications running in a virtual environment is far superior to applications running in a traditional, non-virtualized system.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Encapsulation</strong><br />
A virtual machine is essentially a software container that bundles or “encapsulates” a complete set of virtual hardware resources, as well as an operating system and all its applications, inside a software package. Encapsulation makes virtual machines incredibly portable and easy to manage.You can move and copy a virtual machine from one location to another just like any other software file, or save a virtual machine on any standard data storage medium, from a pocket-sized USB flash memory card to an enterprise storage area networks (SANs).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Hardware Independence</strong><br />
Virtual machines are completely independent from their underlying physical hardware.We can configure a virtual machine with virtual components (eg, CPU, network card, SCSI controller) that are completely different from the physical components that are present on the underlying hardware. Virtual machines on the same physical server can even run different kinds of operating systems (Windows, Linux, etc).Use Virtual Machines as the Building Blocks of your Virtual Infrastructure.</p>
