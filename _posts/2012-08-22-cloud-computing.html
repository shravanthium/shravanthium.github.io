<p style="text-align:justify;">Cloud computing.A catchy word is'nt it..?? that simply refers to accessing the applications via Internet instead of being installed in your computer.So the funda is all about remote servers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="alignleft" src="assets/cloudcomputing.png" alt="" width="298" height="176" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without even being aware of it, all of us most likely have been already using some cloud-enabled programs.Web-based email is a best use case scenario.  If you have, for example, a Hotmail or Gmail email account you’re using a cloud-based program.  These programs store nothing on your computer.  Instead you log onto their servers, enter your credentials and read and send emails.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One good thing about these programs is that they (with a few exceptions) don’t reside on your computer.  That means they aren’t eating up disk space. Also, you don’t have to worry about downloading updates.  The program is always current. Most importantly, though, true cloud apps don’t force you to store your data locally on your computer.  Instead, you save your work on their servers. This allows you to access your work from anywhere anytime just that you have internet connection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Cloud Service Model</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong> is the future of the Cloud! In 2011, we got witness many acquisitions and announcements including Heroku by SalesForce.com and CloudFoundry by VMware. Infact PaaS space is broadly divided among the .NET, Java and LAMP platforms. Though there is no serious competition to Microsoft Windows Azure in the form of a .NET based PaaS, there is a huge competition among the Java PaaS players including Google App Engine, VMware CloudFoundry, RedHat OpenShift and Heorku. Amazon is also vying for this space through its Elastic Beanstalk offering. Oracle also has announced its Java PaaS. So, Java developers have a wide range of PaaS offerings to choose from. Interestingly, the same set of players is adding support for PHP, Python, Ruby and Node.js.  For example, Heroku has added support for Ruby, Node.js, Clojure, Python and Scala. Same is the case with CloudFoundry which claims that it can run PHP (through AppFog), Ruby, Node.js and Scala! Microsoft also wants the developers to believe that they can run their Java and PHP applications on Windows Azure.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I<strong>nfrastructure as a service(IaaS)</strong>, is more of a useful side of cloud computing service for the big companies. They wont be needing to install a copy of windows in each of their nodes or configure severs to do them. In fact, they wont need servers at all. They would be ordering for servers and pre-configured networks online and they will be accessing them online. This implies huge savings for the company for network set-up cost and a wage-loss for the present day network administrator<strong>.Ex:</strong>iCloud.com,Amazon Web Services,Cloudo,Free Zoho,Mint.com, eyeOS.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Software as a service(SaaS)</strong>,are real pieces of software that you can access directly through the internet, no you don’t need to install anything in your computer. In a few years(strike) months  you will not be ‘installing’ Microsoft Office, Antivirus software, Medial Players  or anything in your computers. You will simply open your browser, go to the cloud service vendor and run the application directly! We have amazing examples for this service like google chrome apps, android &amp; iphone apps,etc</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ah.. Too much theory..Grr.. One last Gyaan</p>
<p><strong>Types of cloud computing</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Public cloud </strong>: Public cloud can be accessed by anyone. Can be said as the other name for cloud computing. Example- Amazon Web Services, Google App-Engine, and Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Private cloud </strong>: Private cloud is exclusively meant for a particular organisation and cannot be accessed by anyone else. Thus it is Data-centre that provides hosted service to limited users. Private clouds are more secure but expensive to public clouds. You have to purchase the storage capacity and services required.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Hybrid cloud </strong>: Hybrid cloud links both the public and private cloud for example the database is on the private cloud and the applications managed on public. This is an optimal way to be secure at the same time and get maximum resources available. It is considered to be a fault tolerant architecture, since any failure in private cloud services are compensated with those of public cloud services.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Community cloud </strong>: organizations from a specific community share information on the same cloud managed by themselves or a third party and hosted by service provider.</p>
<p>This was more of a theoretical explanation for the geeks out there I have a technical way rolling in next.. ;)</p>
