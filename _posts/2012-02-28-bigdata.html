<p>After a very long break I'm writing something in this blog, this time my inspiration is my data mining Professor.Before I start what bigdata is, I want to share that incident.</p>
<p>I'm in my 8th semester now and as per curriculum we are supposed to do a project so we formed a team and chose "Machine Learning for BigData" as our project title and submitted project synopsis to our project internal guide.After one week when we went to her to submit weekly progress report of the project she said "why have you put the word 'bigdata' in the title I'm kinda dint like it".Though I could convince her with my explanation I decided to write about today's buzzing topics like hadoop,bigdata,mapreduce,NoSQL,etc</p>
<p>Wikipedia defines <strong>bigdata<span style="font-size:11px;"> as,</span></strong> datasets that grow so large that they become awkward to work with using on-hand database management tools.Difficulties include capture, storage,search, sharing, analytic's and visualizing.</p>
<p>So the question is who is generating this piling up data..???</p>
