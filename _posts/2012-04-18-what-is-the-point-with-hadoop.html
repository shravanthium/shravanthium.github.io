<p>Whenever I have a chitchat or formal talk with a BI or Analytic person, the most widely asked question is</p>
<p>‘<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">what is the point of Hadoop?’.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://shravanthimohan.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/big_data_storage.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" src="assets/big_data_storage.jpg?w=487" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">It is a more fundamental question than ‘what analytic workloads is Hadoop used for’ and really gets to the heart of uncovering why businesses are deploying or considering deploying Apache Hadoop. </span></span><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">There are three core roles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">Big data storage: Hadoop as a system for storing large, unstructured, data sets</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"> Big data integration: Hadoop as a data ingestion/ETL layer</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"> Big data analytic: Hadoop as a platform new new exploratory analytic applications</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">While much of the attention for Apache Hadoop use-cases focuses on the innovative analytic applications it has enabled and high-profile adoption at Web properties. Initial adoption of Hadoop at traditional enterprises and later adopters are more likely triggered by the first two features. Indeed there are some good examples of these three roles representing an adoption continuum.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">We also see the multiple roles playing out at a vendor level, with regards to strategies for Hadoop-related products. Oracle’s Big Data Appliance</span></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">, for example, is focused very specifically on Apache Hadoop as a pre-processing layer for data to be analyzed in Oracle Database. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">While Oracle focuses on Hadoop’s ETL role, it is no surprise that the other major incumbent vendors showing interest in Hadoop can be grouped into three main areas:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">Storage vendors</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">Existing database/integration vendors</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">Business intelligence/analytic vendors</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a small instance I took to showcase how the major DATA players are slowly adopting this new technology to harness its capabilities to retain there position in the major players list.</p>
