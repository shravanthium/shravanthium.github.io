<p>Hello everyone.My name is <a title="Shravanthi" href="http://www.facebook.com/shravanthi.mohan" rel="nofollow">Shravanthi</a>, this is the first time i am blogging online though i am a chronic internet user. As it is my first post i want to start with something which is reason for my today's existence.To begin with, my school Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Hassan.</p>
<p><strong>Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya</strong> are <a title="India" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" rel="nofollow">Indian</a> schools for talented children and form a part of the system of <a title="Gifted education" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifted_education" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#0066cc;">gifted education</span></a>. The objectives of the scheme are to provide good quality modern education to the children predominantly from rural areas, without regard to their family's socio-economic condition.</p>
<p>First established in 1985, they are the brain child of the former Prime Minister, Late. <a title="Rajiv Gandhi" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi" rel="nofollow">Rajiv Gandhi</a> to find and foster talented children from the rural parts of India. They were formerly named as Navodaya Vidyalayas and renamed later as ‘Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas' in the birth-centenary year of <a title="Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandit_Jawahar_Lal_Nehru" rel="nofollow">Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru</a>, the first Prime Minister of Independent India. Navodaya Vidyalayas are located all over the country, except in  <a title="Tamil Nadu" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu" rel="nofollow">Tamil Nadu</a>. There are approximately 557 JNVs across India as of now. They offer free education to all students who get selected through the admission process which includes an All India Entrance Exam, held at district level.</p>

<p>You might be wondering what is so special in my school.These are the schools which are responsible for the existence of so many lives.In my first post i just wanted to express my gratitude to all those millions of people who had worked and who have been working to support children from remote places of India and for being responsible in shaping a new future for millions of young minds.</p>
