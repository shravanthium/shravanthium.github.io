<p id="paragraph1">The Oxford English Dictionary becomes part of the social media technology revolution.</p>

<p>The Oxford English Dictionary has a rule that "a new word needs to be current for ten years before consideration for inclusion".</p>
<p>Chief Editor John Simpson, who made the announcement in a blog spot that, OED breaks its rule to match the tech savy race and adds the words  'Big data' and 'Tweet' to the dictionary.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/june-2013-update/a-heads-up-for-the-june-2013-oed-release/" target="_blank">quarterly update</a> of the Oxford English Dictionary:</p>
<p>The word "<a href="http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/377843#eid295344911" target="_blank">tweet</a>," appearing both as a noun and a verb, was added to the dictionary.</p>
<p><a href="http://shravanthimohan.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/tweet.png"><img class="size-full wp-image aligncenter" id="i-215" alt="Image" src="assets/tweet.png?w=348" /></a></p>
<p>The word 'big data' is also added to the dictionary.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image aligncenter" id="i-213" alt="Image" src="assets/bigdata.png?w=347" /></p>
<p id="paragraph3">The OED got on board with other tech lingo. The words "crowdsourcing," "e-reader," "mouseover," "stream" and "redirect" "Flash mob," 3D printer" and "live-blogging" also made their entry in the century old dictionary.</p>
