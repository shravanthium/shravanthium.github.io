<p>Bitcoin is a virtual and digital version of cash that is emerging as a global payment platform and that can be used through smart phones, tablets, and other devices. Bitcoin, which is a product of open source intelligence using peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks, has the potential to change how millions of people around the world conduct their business.</p>
<p>What makes Bitcoin unique is that there’s a record as to who possesses it, and there’s a network that records transactions. Additionally, there is no way to increase the number of Bitcoins in existence, which is not the case in other currencies, like the U.S. currency, which the treasury can just print more if needed.</p>
<p>The value of a Bitcoin does fluctuate with the markets. Similar to stocks, to invest in Bitcoins all you want to do the same thing you do is to buy low and sell high. But remember, all currencies fluctuate in value on a daily basis, so that’s not unique to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Well, the future of Bitcoin!! Bitcoin’s future represents a soft trend—it is not a sure thing. But the idea of a digital virtual currency that is the closest thing to cash becoming part of our everyday reality in the near future represents a Hard Trend—it will happen.</p>
<p>So the next time you’re ready to make a purchase online, don’t be surprised if you see a Bitcoin option for payment. Digital currency as a long-term Hard Trend is a game changer and Bitcoin is the trend is now in motion.</p>
